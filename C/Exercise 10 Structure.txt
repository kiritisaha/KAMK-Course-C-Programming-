Exercise 10: structs
Define a struct called MOBILEGAME that has three members: name, pulisher and price
In main, create three MOBILEGAME type structs with following information:
game1:  name: HayDay, publisher: Supercell, price: 0.0
game2: name: Geometry Dash, publisher: RobTop Games, price: 2.29
game3: name: Minecraft, publisher: Mojang, price: 7.99
Write a function that gets one struct MOBILEGAME as a parameter and prints out the values its members to the console. Test the function.
Write a function that gets two MOBILEGAME structs as a parameter. 
The function prints out the sum of the games' prices to the console.

struct MOBILEGAME
{
	char name[20];
	char publisher[20];
	float price;
};

void gamedetails(struct MOBILEGAME game)
{
	printf("Name : %s\n Publisher : %s\n Price : %.2f\n", game.name, game.publisher, game.price);
}

void gameprice(struct MOBILEGAME gadha, struct MOBILEGAME goru)
{
	float sum = gadha.price + goru.price;
	printf("The Value / price Sum of the game is %.2F", sum);
}

int main()
{
	struct MOBILEGAME game1 = {"HayDay", "Supercell", 0.0};
	struct MOBILEGAME game2 = {"Geometry Dash", "RobTop Games", 2.29 };
	struct MOBILEGAME game3 = { "Minecraft", "Mojang", 7.99 };

	gamedetails(game1);
	gamedetails(game2);
	gamedetails(game3);
	gameprice(game2, game3);
}

4.1

Write a program that asks the user a number between 1-5 and prints out the given number as a text.
For example “1” should result as “one”. Use switch-case.
Change the program that asks the numbers of months (Exercise 3.2 ) 
so that the user is asked in the end if she wants to enter another month number. 


#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
	int a;
	char again;

	
	do
	{

		printf("Plz input the number of a month: \n");
		scanf("%d", &a);

		switch (a)
		{
		case 1: case 3: case 5: case 7: case 8: case 10: case 12:
			printf("This momth has 31 days\n");
			break;
		case 4: case 6: case 9: case 11:
			printf("This month has 30 days\n");
			break;
		case 2:
			printf("This month has 28 or 29 days\n");
			break;
		default:
			printf("Unknown entry!");
			break;
		}

		printf("Do you Want to check another month? 'y' or 'n' \n");
		scanf(" %c",&again);

	} while (again == 'y');

}



4.2

Write a program where you use rand()-function to generate a secret number between 0 and 20 
The user tries to guess the secret number. After each wrong answer give the user a hint:
 “Your number was too big/too small” etc. The rand-function is used as: int secerNumber = rand() % 20 + 1;
 Before using rand it is recommended to call srand(time(0));
 for initializing the seed mused in random number generation.
 Using srand-function requires the inclusion of time.h header: #include <time.h> 





#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<time.h>

int main()
{
	int input;
	int secerNumber;
	srand(time);
	secerNumber = rand() % 20 + 1;

	while (1)
	{

		printf("Plz guess a number between 1 to 20\n");
		scanf("%d", &input);

	if (secerNumber > input)
	{
		printf("The number you have guessed is too small! try again !!\n");
	}
	else if (secerNumber < input)
	{
		printf("The number you have guessed is Bigger! try again !!\n");
	}
	else if (secerNumber == input)

	{
		printf("Bingo!!The number you have guessed is absoutely right !!!\n");
		break;
	}

	//printf("Secret guess was %d", secerNumber);
	}
}

4.3


Write a program for multiplication table (1-10) rehearsal. 
First the program asks the user to enter the multiplier (1-10) and then it asks the calculations one at a time, 
eg.: 1*2= ?, 2*2=?, 3*2 = ? In the end, the program should print out the number of correct answers.




#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
	int number = 1;
	int multiplier = 0;
	int answer = 0;
	int correctanswer = 0;

	printf("Please enter the multiplier (between 1 to 10) \n");
	scanf("%d", &multiplier);

	while (number <= 10)
	{
		printf("Whats the answer of %d * %d ?\n", number, multiplier);
		scanf("%d", &answer);

		if (answer == number * multiplier)
		{
			correctanswer++;
		}
		number++;
	}
	printf("Your Point is : %d /10 !  \n", correctanswer);
}
